## 1. code_combined_train.ipynb
Showing the whole structure of the project.
Due to the limitations of my local environment, I did all my experiments on colab. So I did not use file structures like: train.py, model.py, ....
This file shows one training example. 

## 2. code_evaluate.ipynb
Showing the example of how to use trained models. Using trained models can save computational cost.

## 3. swat_analysis.ipynb
Showing the details of SWaT.
